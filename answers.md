1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

A: I have spend around 45 minutes. To be honest I was not clear on some of the part for implementation.

2. Why did you choose PHP as your main programming language?

A: It is simple and easy to learn. PHP community is very vast and so large, the proof is the number of 
PHP frameworks available. You can find full support whenever you get stuck with any problem or error while 
writing in PHP scripting language. You can easily search how to learn PHP language because PHP is most widely used 
language all around the world.

3. What is your favourite thing about your most familar PHP framework (Laravel / Symfony etc)? 
A: Symfony:
   1) Your coding speed will be increased thanks for Symfony Flex, a feature based on Symfony Recipes, a set of 
   automated instructions to integrate third-party packages into your application.
   
   2) The code quality of Symfony makes it, as of today, one of the best architected and cleanest PHP frameworks 
   available.
   
   3) Symfony bundles are libraries that are very easy to download and start using in minutes.
   
4. What is your least favourite thing about the above framework

A: Synfony:
   
   1) The default database ORM doctrine is not well documented and has a large learning curve when optimizing for 
   high traffic.
   
   2) For less complex projects, Laravel or Silex (or even WordPress) can be used. Symfony is better for enterprise 
   products than just for the fun of it.
   
   3) Performance can be an issue sometimes, especially with older versions of Symfony.
